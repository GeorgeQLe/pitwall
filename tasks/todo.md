# Todo - Pitwall

> Current phase: 1 of 5 - Foundation And Pacing Core
> Source roadmap: `tasks/roadmap.md`

## Priority Task Queue

- [x] Task pipeline is healthy; no issues found. Ready for `$run`.

## Phase 1: Foundation And Pacing Core

> Test strategy: tdd

**Goal:** Establish the clean-room Swift project foundation and a tested provider-agnostic pacing core before implementing provider credentials, networking, or UI.

**Scope:**
- Create the initial Swift package/app structure for independently authored Pitwall code.
- Define provider-agnostic domain models for provider status, confidence, pacing state, recommendations, reset windows, and usage snapshots.
- Implement deterministic pacing calculations for weekly and session windows, daily budget, today's usage, capped state, and action guidance.
- Keep this phase free of real provider networking, credential storage, and production UI.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A Swift package exists and `swift test` can run locally.
- Pacing tests cover weekly and session calculations, ignore-window behavior, threshold labels, capped utilization, daily budget, and unknown-today behavior.
- Domain models can represent Claude, Codex, Gemini, and future providers without forcing provider-specific quota shapes into one schema.
- The implementation remains clean-room: no copied Swift/Xcode source, assets, screenshots, or tests from the prior ClaudeUsage lineage.
- The scaffold does not store credentials, read provider local files, or call provider networks.

### Execution Profile
**Parallel mode:** serial
**Integration owner:** main agent
**Conflict risk:** medium
**Review gates:** correctness, tests, security, docs/API conformance

**Subagent lanes:** none

### Tests First
- Step 1.1: Create the Swift test harness and write failing tests for the pacing core acceptance criteria
  - Files: create `Package.swift`, create `Tests/PitwallCoreTests/PacingCalculatorTests.swift`, create `Tests/PitwallCoreTests/DailyBudgetTests.swift`
  - Cover weekly pace ratio thresholds: underusing, behind pace, on pace, ahead of pace, warning, critical, capped
  - Cover session pace ignore windows: first 15 minutes and last 5 minutes
  - Cover weekly pace ignore windows: first 6 hours and last 1 hour
  - Cover daily budget with fractional days remaining and unknown local-midnight baseline
  - Tests MUST fail at this point because the core implementation does not exist yet

### Implementation
- Step 1.2: Create the provider-agnostic core model layer
  - Files: create `Sources/PitwallCore/ProviderModels.swift`
  - Include provider identifiers, provider status, confidence labels, pacing labels, actions, reset windows, usage snapshots, and provider state containers
- Step 1.3: Implement pacing calculations and recommendation mapping
  - Files: create `Sources/PitwallCore/PacingCalculator.swift`
  - Implement weekly and session pace ratios, ignore-window handling, capped handling, daily budget, today's usage baseline behavior, and recommendation output
- Step 1.4: Add clean-room project scaffolding notes for future app targets
  - Files: create `Sources/PitwallCore/PitwallCore.swift`, modify `README.md`
  - Document how to run `swift test` and keep implementation inputs tied to specs and public/platform docs only

### Green
- Step 1.5: Run the core test suite and verify all Phase 1 tests pass
  - Command: `swift test`
- Step 1.6: Refactor model naming and calculator boundaries if needed while keeping tests green
  - Files: modify `Sources/PitwallCore/ProviderModels.swift`, modify `Sources/PitwallCore/PacingCalculator.swift`, modify tests only as needed to clarify behavior without weakening coverage

### Milestone: Phase 1 Foundation And Pacing Core
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A Swift package exists and `swift test` can run locally.
- [ ] Pacing tests cover weekly and session calculations, ignore-window behavior, threshold labels, capped utilization, daily budget, and unknown-today behavior.
- [ ] Domain models can represent Claude, Codex, Gemini, and future providers without forcing provider-specific quota shapes into one schema.
- [ ] The implementation remains clean-room: no copied Swift/Xcode source, assets, screenshots, or tests from the prior ClaudeUsage lineage.
- [ ] The scaffold does not store credentials, read provider local files, or call provider networks.
- [ ] All phase tests pass
- [ ] No regressions in previous phase tests

**On Completion:**
- Deviations from plan: none recorded yet
- Tech debt / follow-ups: none recorded yet
- Ready for next phase: no
